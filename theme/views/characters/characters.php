Following his intense battle with the Rogue Cheney of the future, Natsu gains a cross-shaped scar on the left side of his abdomen, a result of the two fatal wounds the man dealt to him during their altercations. He later attains a new scar, this one being a jagged blemish on his right cheek, which he gained following his battle with Zeref. Natsu's guild mark is red and is located just below his right shoulder.</p>

								<span>Gray's</span> most prominent feature is his spiky black-colored hair. He has dark blue eyes, and his body is toned and muscular.
								<br>After the mission on Galuna Island, he gets a scar on his forehead above his left eye that is partially covered by his hair.
								<br>He also has a cross-shaped scar on his lower abdomen received from using Seven Slice Dance: Blood Version on Tenrou Island. His member stamp is below his collarbone on his right pectoral muscle and is dark blue in color.
								<br>Unlike almost all other characters, <span>Gray</span> does not consistently wear the same type of clothes (that is, when he is wearing some), though he is often shown wearing some kind of white coat.

							<span>Lucy</span> has brown eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair that is usually tied by ribbons in a variety of colors in a small ponytail to the right side of her head with the rest of the hair loose. However, in the year X791 she appears to keep her hair up more often in pigtails. She is buxom and has a curvaceous body. In X792, her hair is considerably longer, and she keeps it all in a side ponytail.
							Her pink <span>Fairy Tail</span> stamp is located at the back of her right hand. Additionally, <span>Lucy</span> does not consistently wear the same outfit. However, she always has a belt that, along with keeping her skirt up, holds her Celestial Spirit keys and a whip with a heart-shaped end. She often wears black, leather high heeled boots. She also bears a striking resemblance to her mother.

She has a slender, voluptuous figure that <span>Lucy</span> Heartfilia described as "amazing." <br>Her most common attire consists of a custom-made armor by Heart Kreuz smiths, a blue skirt, black boots, and diamond shaped silver earrings. Her <span>Fairy Tail</span> stamp is blue and is located on the middle of her left upper arm. <span>Erza's</span> specialty in Requip Magic allows her to requip not only armors but different outfits as well, enabling her to change her attire at any given time.

							<span>Wendy</span> is a petite girl with fair skin. As of her introduction, she has long, dark blue hair that reaches down to her waist, with two bangs framing her face which reach down to her chest alongside her brown eyes. Like all Dragon Slayers, she has elongated canine teeth. At first, she wears a simple dress with two wavy stripes running across the dress and ending in small pointed edges at the bottom. Around her arms and legs she wears wing like attachments. <span>Wendy's</span> Cait Shelter Guild stamp was located on her right shoulder, but after the Guild disbanded and she joined <span>Fairy Tail</span>, the stamp was replaced by <span>Fairy Tail's</span> Guild stamp.

					Magic is the physical embodiment of the spirit.
					When the physical spirit of an organism connects with the spiritual flow of nature, the spirit forms Magic as a product of the connection. <br>
					Though Magic goes beyond reason, it is still born of reason and it takes an enormous amount of concentration and mental ability to use it.	<br>
					One's magical powers are also tied to one's life force. <br>
					Only ten percent of the world's population is able to use Magic, which is noted to keep a balance between ordinary people and those with Magic.<br>

					To utilize Magic, a Mage must use the Magic Power (È≠îÂäõ Maryoku) in their body, which is composed of Ethernano („Ç®„Éº„ÉÜ„É´„Éä„Éé ƒíterunano), the source of Magic Power for all Mages.<br>
					Every Mage has a container of Ethernano inside their body that determines the limits of their Magic Power. <br>
					In the case that it becomes empty, Ethernano will come from the atmosphere and enter the Mage's body and, after a while, their Magic Power shall return to normal.<br>
					However, recent studies have identified another, unused, part of a Mage's Magic container that contains a large amount of dormant power: the Second Origin (‰∫åÁï™Âéü„Çª„Ç´„É≥„Éâ„Éª„Ç™„É™„Ç∏„É≥ Sekando Orijin).<br>
					If a Mage somehow manages to unlock their Second Origin, they will then receive an enormous boost in Magic Power, or they can wait until the right moment to unleash the Magic Power of their Second Origin in order to gain an advantage in the battle.<br>
					It has been later revealed by Ultear that a Mage can access the magical strength they will possess in the future via her Arc of Time: Third Origin (Á¨¨‰∏âÈ≠îÊ≥ïÊ∫ê„Çµ„Éº„Éâ„Ç™„É™„Ç∏„É≥ SƒÅdo Orijin); <br>

					Different taboos that are broken have different effects on the user's body. One of them can lead to death or sickness.

					<p style="text-align: left;">There are <strong>two</strong> main classifications of Magic: <u>Caster Magic</u> and <u>Holder Magic</u>. Within these two classifications there are many sub categories such as Edolas Items, Lost Magic, and Magic Items.</p>
					<ul type="disc" style="text-align: left;">
						<li><strong>Caster Magic</strong>: („Ç≠„É£„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éû„Ç∏„ÉÉ„ÇØ KyasutƒÅ Majikku) is Magic that is expelled from the body as opposed to Magic done through the use of a weapon or outside source.</li>
						<li><strong>Holder Magic</strong>: („Éõ„É´„ÉÄ„Éº„Éû„Ç∏„ÉÉ„ÇØ HorudƒÅ Majikku) is Magic that requires a Mage to use an external source to produce the Magic. It usually requires the use of Magic Power, though there are some exceptions such as Edolas Items that are powered by Lacrima.</li>
						<li><strong>Ancient Spell</strong>: (Âè§‰ª£È≠îÊ≥ï„Ç®„É≥„Ç∑„Çß„É≥„Éà„Çπ„Éö„É´ Enshento Superu), as its name implies, is Magic from ancient times. It includes all forms of Lost Magic, Nirvana, Memory-Make, Ars Magia as well as all of the Black Arts.</li>
						<li><strong>Lost Magic</strong>: (Â§±„Çè„Çå„ÅüÈ≠îÊ≥ï„É≠„Çπ„Éà„Éû„Ç∏„ÉÉ„ÇØ Rosuto Majikku) is a type of Magic that has been obliterated from the history of the world due to their immense power and the sheer gravity of their side effects on the users.</li>
						However, users of such Magic still exist, though the Magic itself is believed to be extremely rare.
